## 🔍 Important Notes

### Registration Color vs Fight Color
- **(R-151)** means fighter #151 is registered as Red
- But in a specific fight, they might fight in the Blue corner
- The website correctly shows opponents, regardless of colors

### Duplicate Fight Numbers
- Some matchups appear multiple times (e.g., CHERINE FAKKOUL appears in fights 113, 117, 151, 159)
- This is normal in tournament brackets (different rounds/pages)
- Website automatically removes duplicates for clean display

### Fight Number = Fighter Number
- Some fight numbers match fighter numbers (e.g., #151)
- This is coincidental - fight #151 is a different thing than fighter #151
- The system correctly distinguishes between them

## 🎨 Customization

All design is in `index.html`. You can customize:
- Colors (search for color codes like #667eea)
- Font sizes
- Layout spacing
- Auto-refresh interval (search for "30000" = 30 seconds)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Website not updating?
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for errors
2. Verify fight_results.json has valid JSON syntax
3. Wait full 3 minutes after commit

### Fight missing?
- Check fight_data.json to see all extracted fights
- Some fights only appear if fighters advance in bracket

### Wrong fighter shown?
- Parser extracts based on club name position in PDF
- If wrong, please open an issue with the specific case
